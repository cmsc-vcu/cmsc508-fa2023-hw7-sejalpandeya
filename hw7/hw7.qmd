In this document is a database which uses a sql dagabase. The document has python code based off connecting the database and has a crowfoot diagram to show the structure of the database.

(Please clean up any comments that I included.  This is a scaffold document.)

## Overview and description

This project uses python coding for the database by sql. It connects the databse, queries and has manipulation of data based off python. There are entities and attributes such as the entities being customer,delivery adress and order. The project also has examples based off people,roles,and skills.

## Crows-foot diagram

The diagram is a crow food er diagram where there are customer,order, and delivery entity with the attirubutes being first and last names.

```{mermaid}
%%| echo: false
erDiagram
    CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places
    CUSTOMER }|..|{ DELIVERY-ADDRESS : uses
    CUSTOMER{
        int id
        string first_name
        string last_name
    }
    DELIVERY-ADDRESS {
        int id
    }
```

## Examples of data in the database

For the people, skills, and roles tables, provide a description of each table and it's contents. Then provide a listing of the entire table.

### People table

The *people* table contains elements that describe ... 

Below is a list of data in the *people* table.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
sql = f"""
select * from people;
"""
## Add code to list roles table here

try:
    df = pd.read_sql(sql,cnx)
    df
except Exception as e:
    message = str(e)
    print(f"An error occurred:\n\n{message}\n\nIgnoring and moving on.")
    df = pd.DataFrame()
df
```

### Skills table

The *skills* table contains elements that describe ... 

Below is a list of data in the *skills* table.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true

## Add code to list roles table here
import pandas as pd
sql_skills = "select * from skills;"
try:
    df_skills=pd.read_sql(sql_skills,cnx)
    df_skills
except Exception as e:
        message= str(e)
        print(f"An error occurred:\n\n{message}\n\nIgnoring and moving on.")
        df = pd.DataFrame()
df
```

### Roles table

The *roles* table contains elements that describe ... 

Below is a list of data in the *roles* table.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true

## Add code to list roles table here
import pandas as pd
sql_roles = "select * from roles;"
try:
    df_roles=pd.read_sql(sql_roles,cnx)
    df_roles
except Exception as e:
        message= str(e)
        print(f"An error occurred:\n\n{message}\n\nIgnoring and moving on.")
        df_roles = pd.DataFrame()
df
     
```


## Sample queries

Let's explore the database!

# List skill names, tags, and descriptions ordered by name

(here a sample query)

```{python}
sql = f"""
select * from people
"""
```


(and here is a sample result from the query)

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
try:
    df = pd.read_sql(sql,cnx)
    df
except Exception as e:
    message = str(e)
    print(f"An error occurred:\n\n{message}\n\nIgnoring and moving on.")
    df = pd.DataFrame()
df

```


### List people names and email addresses ordered by last_name


### List skill names of Person 1


### List people names with Skill 6


### List people with a DEVELOPER role


### List names and email addresses of people without skills


### List names and tags of unused skills


### List people names and skill names with the BOSS role


### List ids and names of unused roles


## Reflection

(Write a paragraph expressing your thoughts, feelings, and insights about your experience with this assignment.  Pause and breath before writing - I'm trying to encourage critical thinking and self-awareness while allowing you to explore the connections between theory and practice. And yes, delete this paragraph.)
